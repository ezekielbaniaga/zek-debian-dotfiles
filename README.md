  These are my customization files that are used to personalized my Debian OS on machine running on ASUS TUF FX505DY. They are stored here for convenience so that I may quickly access them on new machines or new installs.  Also, others may find some of my configurations helpful in customizing their own dotfiles.

Repo name came from `zek-debian` which is the name of the machine. `zek` is not a Greek word, it is just my nickname.
